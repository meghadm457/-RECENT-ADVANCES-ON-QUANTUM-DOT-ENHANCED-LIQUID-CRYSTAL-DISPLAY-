# -RECENT-ADVANCES-ON-QUANTUM-DOT-ENHANCED-LIQUID-CRYSTAL-DISPLAY-
Recent advances in quantum dot (QD)-enhanced liquid crystal displays (LCDs), including material formulation, device configuration, and system integration. For the LCD system, we first compare the color gamut difference between the commonly used Gaussian fitting method and that using real emission spectra. Next, we investigate the Helmholtzâ€“Kohlrausch effect. Our simulation results indicate that QD-enhanced LCD appears 1.26X more efficient than organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display due to its wider color gamut. Finally, two new trends for QDLCDs are discussed: 1) replacing conventional color filters with a QDarray, and2) emergingquantumrod (QR)-enhancedbacklight. Their inherent advantages, technical challenges, and potential solutions are presented. We believe the prime time for QDenhanced LCDs is around the corner.
